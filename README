python3 spectrum.py

Optionally you can try to use -OO optimization flags:

Ctrl(being in normal mode) + AnyKey => big/small chars
Ctrl(being in special mode) + AnyKey => symbol shift 2





Thanks to Jasper(http://www.spectrum.lovely.net/) for real great Java emulator of
ZX Spectrum. Big amount of code was just automatically translated from Java into
Python, so we need more optimization/rewriting to reach good speed of emulation.

TODO: 
------------------
* Another, real Python approach for the core (Z80 CPU)
* Threads in parallel (video and maybe keyboard)
* TAP/TZX files reading
